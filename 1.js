// js is dynamically typed we need not to tell what we are storing in a varible

// To print
console.log("hello world");

// variables:- these are the containers used to store values
// number
age = 25;
console.log(age);
// string
name = "areeb";
console.log("name");
// boolean
isFollow = true;
console.log(isFollow);
/* null:- absense of any value */
x = null;
console.log(x);
/* undefined:- means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value yet */
y = undefined;
console.log(y);
/*
          variables rules
1. variables names are case sensitive "a" and "A" are different
2. only letters,digits,underscore(_) and $ is allowed,
  below eg will show error

1name = "shoaib"
console.log(1name); 
3. only letters,underscore(_) and $ can be 1st character

4. reserved words cannot be variables names eg console = 25;
